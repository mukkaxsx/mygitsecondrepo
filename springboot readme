Spring Boot is a framework for building Java-based applications, designed to simplify the process of creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications. It is part of the larger Spring Framework ecosystem, which provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications.

Here are some key features and benefits of Spring Boot:

1. Auto-configuration: Spring Boot automatically configures your application based on the dependencies you have added to the project. This reduces the need for manual configuration and allows you to get started quickly.

2. Embedded Servers: Spring Boot includes embedded web servers like Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow, which means you can run your Spring application as a standalone Java application without needing to deploy it to an external server.
